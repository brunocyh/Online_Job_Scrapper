# What is it?
So this is a web crawler that crawls through the mainstream jobboards in Australia. Eh.. so why do I want to spend my entire weekend building this thing? I have a few problems faced when I started looking jobs online...

The Problem I faced: 
- I have to look for jobboard one by one
- I have multiple search terms which return me with different job sugegstions (eg python developer, data scientist)
- I want to skip through annoying job titles like manager / senior (I am a fresh grad!)
- Jobboards normally returns 10 - 15 jobs in a time 
- I am concerned about the job details (content), some say aussie citizenship is required.. some say 5 years of experience
- oh.. how is the job opportunity in sydney and melbourn..?
- Yes, it is just way too TIME CONSUMING and tedious and boring! But this is how we normally job hunt!

My Solution:
- this crawler lists out all the jobs available gathered from the first few pages in mainstream jobboards in no time
- I can also search multiple terms at once
- duplicates that returned from different jobboards/search terms will be elminate
- all jobs are export to structured csv file
- job descriptions of each jobs returned are then evaluated. Will outline the keywords I am looking for from each job's description
- All the problems listed above are solved!
