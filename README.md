# Online_Job_Scrapper
The story: I was graduated in Brisbane 2017 December, as an international student. After deciding to stay back for quality working experiences, I started job hunting in Brisbane. It was a big challenge for an international student like me to join the professional workforce, it didnt take me long to realize it (after job hunting for 2 weeks). Thus, I decided to build an automatic solution that helps me to do the job everyday, so I can focus on other stuff instead of browsing the net for hours and hours everyday. I was hoping the machine would filter/highlight some keywords that I was concerning about and returns only jobs that I am interested. The first version of this job scrapper were built in Feb, 2018. It was helpful, but very messy with plenty of code smells. However, thanks to this job scrapper, I was given chances to be interviewed and eventually secured a software engineer position. In mid-2019, I decided to re-build this scrapper so that it has a better architecture and further developments can be done based on the current product.

Early-2018 version:
- Does the job (polite policy applies! I hate spamming web hosts)
- Focus on job hunts in Australia
- Supports -- AU: Neuvoo, Seek, Gumtree, Indeed
- Acheivement: saved me heaps of time in browsing various jobboards; also landed me internship and eventually a software engineer position

Mid-2019 version:
- Refactored the entire architecture, extensible for other application
- Enhance performance
- Unit tests included
- Additional jobboard support: Stackoverflow
- Additional countries supported: HK, SG
