# Online_Job_Scrapper

### The story:

Upon graduation in December 2017 December, I started job hunting in Brisbane. It was a huge challenge for an international student like me to join the local professional workforce, and it didnt take me long to realize it (after job hunting for 2 weeks). So I decided to build an automatic solution that helps me to do the job everyday, so I can focus on perhaps just a sip of Brissie coffe, hmmmmm. I was hoping this machine could filter and highlight some new jobs quoted on various mainstream job board every single day. 

#### Early 2018
The first generation of this job scrapper was built in Feb, 2018. Helpful, but not maintainable. However, thanks to this job scrapper, I was given chances to be interviewed and eventually secured a software engineer position. 
- Does the job (polite policy applies! I hate spamming web hosts)
- Focus on job hunts in Australia
- Purpose: Facilitate myself to find jobs
- Acheivement: saved me heaps of time in browsing various jobboards; also landed me internship and eventually a software engineer position

#### Mid 2019
In mid-2019, I decided to re-build this scrapper so that it has a better architecture, allowing me to practice design patterns and better algorithm thinking.
- Refactored the entire architecture, extensible for other application
- Enhance multi-threading performance
- Unit Tests included

##### Early 2023
And now in 2023, I am back to enhancing this scrapper again. Why? Reach out to me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunocheung/ I will tell you why ;) I am planning to implement the following:
- Major refactoring. Efficiency, performance enhancement
- Target jobs in Dubai
- Dockerize and cloud-based

** NOTE:
All in all, just for fun :) Happy coding.
