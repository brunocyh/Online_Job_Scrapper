# Online_Job_Scrapper
The story: I was graduated in Brisbane 2017 December, as an international student. It was a big challenge for an international student like me to join the professional workforce, it didnt take me long to realize it (after job hunting for 2 weeks). Thus, I decided to build an automatic solution that helps me to do the job everyday, so I can focus on other stuff instead of browsing the net for hours and hours everyday. The first version of this job scrapper were built in Feb, 2018. It was usable, but very messy with plenty of code smells. However, thanks to this job scrapper, I was given chances to be interviewed and eventually landed a software engineer position. In mid-2019, I decided to re-build this scrapper so that it has a better architecture and further developments can be done based on the current product.

2018 version:
- Does the job
- Acheivement: saved me heaps of time in browsing various jobboards; also landed me internship and eventually a software engineer position

2019 version:
- improve architecture of the overall software, extensible for other application
-
